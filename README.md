# IndianaTechBaseball
This repository includes information on my Azure ASP.NET web app with SQL Database showing Indiana Tech Baseball 2022 statistics. 

## Project Overview

- This project for Cloud Computing is using a two-tier model. It is compromised of a front-end ASP.NET web app with a back-end SQL Database portion. It displays statistics for the Indiana Tech Warriors 2022 baseball season, of which I am apart of and passionate about. 
- The "Hitting" statistics page shows all of the hitters statistics in the 2022 season through using an ASP.NET web app. The "Pitching" statistics page shows all of the pitchers statisitcs in the 2022 season through a back-end SQL Database that is linked to the front-end ASP.NET web app. 
- For the SQL Database, I planned on manually inputting pitchers data into the SQL database of each pitcher on the team, while still being able to add new pitchers, edit, and delete rows using the front-end web application as up dated statistics become available for pitchers (as I am a pitcher as well). 

## Diagram
 - I used Micrsoft Visio for a visual representation of this project to show how everything is connected to each other in my resource group. 
 - It includes dependancies, for example, the SQL Database is dependant on the SQL Server and the Web Application is hosted by the Web App Plan and how they are connected between each other through the connection string.
